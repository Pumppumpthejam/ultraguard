# Ultraguard - Advanced Security System

Ultraguard is a comprehensive security system that combines multiple security features including motion detection, facial recognition, and real-time alerts. The system is designed to provide robust security monitoring and response capabilities.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Real-time motion detection with configurable sensitivity
- **Facial Recognition**: Advanced facial recognition system with database support
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications for security events
- **Video Recording**: Automatic recording of security events
- **User Management**: Secure user authentication and authorization
- **Web Interface**: Modern web-based control panel
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for system control and monitoring

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- SQLite3
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
